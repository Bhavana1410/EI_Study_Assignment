Design Patterns Implementation in Java
This repository demonstrates the implementation of six different design patterns (two use cases for each category: behavioral, creational, and structural) using Java. Each pattern is implemented in adherence to global best practices, focusing on clean code, optimization, and modular structure. All the classes are separated into different files for better organization and scalability.

Behavioral Design Patterns:
Observer Pattern - Weather Monitoring System:

A weather station system that notifies multiple devices whenever the weather conditions change. Devices subscribe to updates and are notified in real-time about weather changes.
Strategy Pattern - Payment Processing System:

A flexible payment system that allows users to select between different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal) to process payments. The strategy pattern is used to enable dynamic method selection without altering the core logic.
Creational Design Patterns:
Singleton Pattern - Configuration Manager:

A configuration manager that ensures a single instance is maintained across the entire application. It allows different parts of the application to access and modify global configurations safely.
Factory Pattern - Vehicle Factory:

A vehicle factory that produces different types of vehicles (e.g., Car, Bike) based on user input. The factory pattern centralizes object creation logic, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
Structural Design Patterns:
Adapter Pattern - Media Player:

A media player that supports multiple formats (e.g., MP3, VLC). The adapter pattern is used to make different incompatible media formats work seamlessly together in a unified player interface.
Decorator Pattern - Coffee Shop:

A flexible coffee ordering system where users can add ingredients (e.g., Milk, Sugar) to their coffee. The decorator pattern enables dynamic addition of functionality without modifying the base class, keeping the design extensible and clean.
